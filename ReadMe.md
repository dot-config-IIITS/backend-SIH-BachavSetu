Go to Routes/client_routes.py you can see which routes and namespaces... <br>
Example : for client_routes.py namespace is '/client' (mentioned in app.py)

You can write class-based namespaces on client side<br>
Example : go to Test/Routes/client_routes.py (this is python implementation)<br>
But I am confident that there would be something like this in dart too <br>

## Test 
This folder has python-sockets-client code, ignore this <br>
I use this to test my server code

## Database 
This consists internal working with the mongodb, ignore this..
